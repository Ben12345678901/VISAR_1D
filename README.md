Velocimetery Interferometery System for Any Reflector (VISAR) simulation code. Produces an interferogram using an input velocity profile, the fringe pattern is produced from a mach-zhender interferometer
and the interferogram is imaged using a streak camera. 

This is meant for general use, the code is capable of adjusting the number of fringes seen on the interferogram, wavelength of the input probe beam, time window of the visar
